## `What's CogniX`

CogniX is a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system capable of transforming various industries by leveraging AI. While RAG systems can handle complex tasks across sectors such as telecommunications, banking, healthcare, retail, and utilities, developing comprehensive solutions for these areas is time-consuming.

## `Initial Focus`

To quickly bring a product to market, we are focusing on two key aspects:

- üîç **Semantic Search for Business:** A plug-in for business applications like Teams, Slack, and SharePoint, providing efficient search functionality directly within these tools. The first implementation will be for Microsoft Teams.
- ü§ñ **AI Chatbot:** A versatile chatbot that can be integrated into any website, capable of talking about the site's products or services, handling customer support and various other topics as instructed.

## `Future Vision`

Gian and Michael, the co-founders, are conducting interviews with CXOs and decision-makers to identify market needs and refine our offerings. As we progress, CogniX will evolve to address more complex use cases and expand its impact across various industries.

## `Converting knowledge to textual format`
A crucial aspect of any RAG is to convert any sort of knowledge in textual format so that it can be fed into a vector database. With this in mind, we are working on:
- Connecting various data sources
- Extracting textual information from an increasing number of file types

We have already developed connectors for:
- Google Drive
- OneDrive
- Microsoft Teams chat and Teams, including files
- Websites
- YouTube videos

We can extract textual data from video, audio, images, and the most common file extensions:
- Documents: PDF, XPS, TXT, DOCX, DOC, XLSX, XLS, PPTX, PPT, HWPX, EPUB, MOBI, FB2, CBZ, MD
- URLs: URL, YT
- Audio/Video: MP4, MP3, MPEG, MPGA, M4A, WAV, WEBM, MOV
- Images: JPEG, JPG, PNG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, TIF, WEBP, PPM, PGM, PBM

## `Funding`
In our [pitch deck video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grWGugrkxew), we mentioned that we are seeking $1 million in funding for a 9% equity stake in the company. This investment will be crucial, with roughly 80% allocated for project development and 20% for marketing and sales. We are looking for venture capital and also considering crowdfunding. If you're interested, you can support us by purchasing a portion of this 9% stake.

## `Contributing`
We need help in various areas, including web development for integration, AI improvement, and Kubernetes/CICD pipelines. 
If you have the skills and passion, we offer both stock and monetary compensation. 
This is a great opportunity to join us on this exciting journey.
