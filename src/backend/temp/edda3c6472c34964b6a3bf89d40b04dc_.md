#Gian Paolo Santopaolo
##Corrado Cavalli Andreas Görög there is an update about this bug, it seems fixed and fix will be released after UniversalWindowsPlatform NuGet package version 6.2.3. see https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/33704 ( https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/33704. ).
So we have to wait  for this

#Gian Paolo Santopaolo
##* SignalR is actually not working and we are looking for a solution with the .Net Core Team, see conversation here
https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR/issues/4272
and here https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/33704

* Cryptography is working but it needs to be tested deeply
* CollaBoard is already working (except for the realtime part)
* DocumentExplorer shoud be working today? Corrado Cavalli updates on timings?
* Implementation is ok for Windows, several parts hast to be written (almost from scratch for Android and/or iOS).
Next Work to do (after DE working)

* Extract ViewModels and other code that now is I n the App's project and refactor to .Net Standard 2.0 library
* Start Xamarin development for other platfor ms
*

##The most of the porting to .Net standard is done. There are some problems though:
