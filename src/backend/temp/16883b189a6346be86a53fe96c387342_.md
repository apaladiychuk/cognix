<div>I've created a build of CB (RS2-PRISM) nothing new compared to dev/vnext but it has been refactored to be ported to netstandard and supports latest 1809 build of Windows. It still targets RS2 for compatibility. Please start using it and report any issue you find with it.</div>

<div>please uninstall any previous version before installing this build.</div>

<div>Thanks.</div>
