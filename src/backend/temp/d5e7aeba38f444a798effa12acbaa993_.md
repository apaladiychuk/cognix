##Gian Paolo Santopaolo Can we test these RS5 builds with the actually installed server versions or is a new server version needed ?

#Gian Paolo Santopaolo
##Andreas Görög You can install all the on-premises environments you want. On Azure we have just the prod and dev environment. At least one Azure environment is needed.
Corrado Cavalli it's ok for now to use PROD for tests, but in general we do need at least one more environment on Azure.
If Andreas Görög wants to test on premises just ask him the URL of the new environment

#Corrado Cavalli
##Andreas Görög Gian Paolo Santopaolo can we use DEV instead?

#Andreas Görög
##We can install a new internal onPrem env using the existing onPrem Server installation, can we use this for the tests ? 

#Gian Paolo Santopaolo
##Andreas Görög Corrado Cavalli to test pointing to prod env it is definitely not the best approach. We need a third environment asap....

#Corrado Cavalli
##Andreas Görög I've added your email to distribution list for CB builds, let me know if you don't get next builds...

#Corrado Cavalli
##PROD as all the betas...

#Gian Paolo Santopaolo
##Corrado Cavalli where is pointing the new CB rs5 build?
