## Package Name: connector

This Go package handles the interaction with the Microsoft Teams messaging platform. It does so by establishing a connector between your Go application and MSTeams.

## Main Types in the Package

1. `MSTeams`: This is the main type in the package. It establishes a connection with MSTeams and holds the client for executing API calls. It also contains important parameters like session ID and filesize limit, and pointers to other key structures like MSTeamState and MSTeamParameters.

   ```golang
   type MSTeams struct {
   Base
   param         *MSTeamParameters
   state         *MSTeamState
   client        *resty.Client
   fileSizeLimit int
   sessionID     uuid.NullUUID
   }
   ```

2. `MSTeamParameters`: This type holds parameters needed to interact with MSTeams. This includes the team, channels, an OAuth2 token for authentication, and flags such as whether to analyze chats and what files to interact with.

   ```golang
   type MSTeamParameters struct {
   Team         string                      `json:"team"`
   Channels     model.StringSlice           `json:"channels"`
   AnalyzeChats bool                        `json:"analyze_chats"`
   Token        *oauth2.Token               `json:"token"`
   Files        *microsoftcore.MSDriveParam `json:"files"`
   }
   ```

3. `MSTeamState`: This structure holds the state of the MSTeams connection after each execution, including Channel and Chat States.

   ```golang
   type MSTeamState struct {
   Channels map[string]*MSTeamChannelState `json:"channels"`
   Chats    map[string]*MSTeamMessageState `json:"chats"`
   }
   ```

4. `MSTeamChannelState`: It holds information about the state of specific channels in MSTeams, like the DeltaLink for detecting changes after the last execution, and the Topics which hold message states.

   ```golang
   type MSTeamChannelState struct {
   // Link for request changes after last execution
   DeltaLink string                         `json:"delta_link"`
   Topics    map[string]*MSTeamMessageState `json:"topics"`
   }
   ```

5. `MSTeamMessageState`: It contains information about the state of specific messages in MSTeams.

   ```golang
   type MSTeamMessageState struct {
   LastCreatedDateTime time.Time `json:"last_created_date_time"`
   }
   ```

## Usage

This package provides a robust way of interacting with MSTeams through your Go services. By establishing a connection with MSTeams, you can programmatically create, analyze, and interact with messages, channels, and files on MSTeams. The package leverages the resty client for executing the API calls and OAuth2 for authentication.
