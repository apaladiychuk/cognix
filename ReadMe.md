## `What's CogniX`
Our mission is to augment humans with AI.

## `What's CogniX`
AI can be difficult to use, CogniX fills the gap that there is between humans and AI.
And it augments it with all your knowledge on the palm of your hand.

Imagine to be an engineer, facing an issue on the system.
Now it would be nice to quickly find my notes and related manuals to solve the issue....
Probably you spent more time chasing your notes than actually solving the issue :) 

A teacher preparing lessons and exams for the week, or the semester 

Well with CogniX you can just type in: 
- I need to solve 

being able to access information on your manuals, personal notes,
