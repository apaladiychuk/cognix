CogniX is now transformed into an AI-powered chatbot solution, leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology. This evolution allows you to deploy intelligent chatbots for sales, support, and customer engagement with minimal setup.
<br />

# `Features`
A versatile chatbot that can be integrated into any website, capable of 
- **Talking about the site's products or services**
- **Handling customer support**
- **Can book an appointment**
- **Custom topics as instructed**

For detailed documentation and setup guides, visit [CogniX Docs](https://docs.cognix.ch/).
If you're not familiar with RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u47GtXwePms).

## `Contributing`
We need help in various areas, including web development (React), AI improvement, and Kubernetes/CICD pipelines.

We are specifically looking for developers skilled in: 
- React

If you want to dedicate part of your time to help us create an innovative solution, you will be compensated with equity, which you can redeem once we secure early-stage funding.

## `Funding`
In our [pitch deck video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grWGugrkxew), we mentioned that we are seeking $1 million in funding for a 9% equity stake in the company. This investment will be crucial, with roughly 80% allocated for project development and 20% for marketing and sales. We are looking for venture capital and also considering crowdfunding. If you're interested, you can support us by purchasing a portion of this 9% stake.

## `Future Vision`

Gian and Michael, the co-founders, are conducting interviews with CXOs and decision-makers to identify market needs and refine our offerings. As we progress, CogniX will evolve to address more complex use cases and expand its impact across various industries.
