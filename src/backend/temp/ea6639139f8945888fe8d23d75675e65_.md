<div><div><at id="0">Dev Team</at>&nbsp;I've talked with <at id="1">Corrado Cavalli</at>&nbsp;and by the end of this week we are trying to release both CB (without realtime but fully working stand alone user) and DE for beta to test. <at id="2">Andreas Görög</at>&nbsp;it would be great if you can arrange some testing sessions for next week so that also Corrado can join (if needed)&nbsp;</div>

<div><at id="0">Andreas Görög</at>&nbsp;<at id="1">Gian Paolo Santopaolo</at> Both CB (w/o realtime) and DE (full) are now pushed on relative dev/vnext branches. You can pull both (main app and IBV_Commons) and compile them.</div>

<div>Since it has a massive refactoring, after pulling, close and reopen Visual Studio and clean the solution before build the project.</div>

<div>At the moment DevOps build fails with multitargeting projects, I'm investigating on it.</div>

<div>To be clear: No new implementation, just moved to latest SDK 1809, so Windows 17773 is required to run (Hub is out) and ported, where possible, all code to .NET Standard for later reuse.</div>

<div>We need now to identify any regression introduced by this massive code refactoring.</div>

<div itemprop="copy-paste-block"><span style="font-size:14px">Let me know how we can pull the newest server and client versions. Actually we still have the version before the porting in the local sln's and have not pulled anything since then. </span></div>
