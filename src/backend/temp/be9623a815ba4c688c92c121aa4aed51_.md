##Corrado Cavalli : I downloaded this build and tested if I can login to the IBV environment.

But I get the error message, that the username is not valid.

#Michael Görög
##Corrado Cavalli : Thank you. Now I can login, but not connect to the server. I will check with Oli if Server and Storage address are correct.

#Corrado Cavalli
##Michael Görög Ah... so that is not the right build... you should have received one yesterday evening with IBV ON PREMISE

#Michael Görög
##Corrado Cavalli : Yes this is working, but we need to test it internaly to check if DFS is working or not. So we need a version where we are able to connect to Z.

#Corrado Cavalli
##Michael Görög does it work with Guest1/... user?

#Michael Görög
##Corrado Cavalli : I installed 1.3.61. If I click on AD I still see the Guest user. When I try to connect using my AD credentials, I still get the same error:

#Corrado Cavalli
##Michael Görög Let me schedule a new build (61) and let me know if it works with that...

#Michael Görög
##Corrado Cavalli : Yes I did. I tested on another device as well (uninstall and reinstall) but I have the issue that I cant login. What other options do we have? (Just for your Info, when I click on AD Login, User Name, Passwort and Domain are already filled with the Guest1 User).

#Corrado Cavalli
##Michael Görög build is right, that commit refer to IBV on premise server, did you try uninstall previous version?

#Michael Görög
##Can you please check if this is the right build or not?
