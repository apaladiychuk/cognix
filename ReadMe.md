## `What's CogniX`

CogniX is a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system capable of transforming various industries by leveraging AI. While RAG systems can handle complex tasks across sectors such as telecommunications, banking, healthcare, retail, and utilities, developing comprehensive solutions for these areas is time-consuming.

## `Initial Focus`

To quickly bring a product to market, we are focusing on two key aspects:

- üîç **Semantic Search for Business:** A plug-in for business applications like Teams, Slack, and SharePoint, providing efficient search functionality directly within these tools. The first implementation will be for Microsoft Teams.
- ü§ñ **AI Chatbot:** A versatile chatbot that can be integrated into any website, capable of handling customer support and various other topics as instructed.

## `Future Vision`

Gian and Michael, the co-founders, are conducting interviews with CXOs and decision-makers to identify market needs and refine our offerings. As we progress, CogniX will evolve to address more complex use cases and expand its impact across various industries.
