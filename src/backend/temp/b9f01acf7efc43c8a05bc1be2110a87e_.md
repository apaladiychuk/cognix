<div><div><at id="0">Gian Paolo Santopaolo</at>: At the moment we have several bugs in DE that should be fixed now, but are Hub related so I did not test them yet. Is it ok if Corrado publishes a new build to the store, so we can test the Hub related issues this week?&nbsp;</div>

<div><div><at id="0">Corrado Cavalli</at>: Thank you, I will test tomorrow the issues related to the hub. <at id="1">Gian Paolo Santopaolo</at>: What do you think regarding the issue 218? The issue here is that DropBox will never work on the Hub, because it is not possible to copy&amp;past the code, that needs to be copied to make it work.&nbsp;</div>

<div><div><at id="0">Michael Görög</at>&nbsp;Several?&nbsp;212 was updated on Nov 30th,&nbsp;218 We can't do nothing if Hub doesn't provide a copy/paste option, 216 should have been fixed two weeks ago. Others? Meantime I will prepare another build for the Hub.</div>

<div><div><at id="0">Corrado Cavalli</at>: For example the bug where on the Hub was the singel user interface when starting the app the first time (212) or the issue with DropBox (218) where it is not really possible to use it on the Hub, because the code can't be copied.&nbsp; Or (216) where we got a Panda when doing copy &amp; paste from google drive. I am not sure if these are really Hub related but we spotted these bugs, when doing the test on the Hub.</div>
